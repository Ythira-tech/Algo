Algorithm:Sentence Analyzer

Objective:
To read a sentence character by character, ending with a period, and calculate:
1. The total number of characters.
2. The number of words (separated by single spaces).
3. The number of vowels.

Steps;
1. Start
2. Declare three variables:

     length ← 0 → counts number of characters

     words ← 0 → counts number of words

     vowels ← 0 → counts number of vowels
3. Display message: "Enter a sentence that ends with a period:"
4. Read the sentence one character at a time.
5. While the current character is not a period'.':
    a. Increase length by 1
    b. If the character is a space:
        → Increase words by 1
    c. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u in both cases):
        → Increase vowels by 1
    d. Read next character
6. When the character is a period '.', increase length by 1 and stop reading
7. Increase words by 1 ,to include the last word
8. Display the results:
   - "Length of sentence =", length
   - "Number of words =", words
   - "Number of vowels =", vowels
9. End
